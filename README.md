# Flutter beautiful UI's

Here you can find a collection of beautiful designed Apps 
developed in Flutter with hard work and :heart:

With this project we want to recreate various designs of UI's and develop them in Flutter. Furthermore we want to share our implementation of those. You can see wich Widgets we used to realize the given design and also inspect our custom made Widgets to achieve the custom shaped designs.
